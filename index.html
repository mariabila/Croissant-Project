    <h1>🥐CROISSANT</h1>
    <p>
      Croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many
      European countries. Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around
      any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked, or sliced to
      include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit
      such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and
      Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without
      added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.
